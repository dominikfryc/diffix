# Getting started

Diffix is a modern, performant, customizable, open-source Web Components UI library based on a custom design system. Works with any JavaScript framework out-of-the-box. It's built with Lit, Vite, and TypeScript.

- Build a modern, highly performant, and highly accessible web experience.
- Integrate with popular frameworks like React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, etc.
- Build a standards-based user interface following W3C Web Component standards.
- Customize the design language for your project by modifying design tokens.
- Use the components out-of-the-box in existing front-end projects.

## Instalation

Make sure you have the latest [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine. Use a package manager to install Diffix from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/diffix-test):

<Source
  language="bash"
  code={`
npm install diffix-test
`}
/>

## Import components

Import the target component from `diffix-test/components/component-name`. Import automatically registers the Web Component (causes a side effect).

<Source
  language="ts"
  code={`
import 'diffix-test/components/button';
`}
/>

Or you can import all components at once:

<Source
  language="ts"
  code={`
import 'diffix-test';
`}
/>

## Import theme

To use the theme, import the CSS file.

1. Using an application bundler (Webpack, Rollup, Vite, etc.):

<Source
  language="ts"
  code={`
import 'diffix-test/themes/default.css';
`}
/>

2. Or using a `<link>` tag:

<Source
  language="html"
  code={`
<link href="/node_modules/diffix-test/dist/themes/default.css" rel="stylesheet" />
`}
/>

## Import font

To import the theme font, add the following lines to the `<head>` of your HTML document:

<Source
  language="html"
  code={`
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com" />
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;500;600;700&display=swap" />
`}
/>

## Usage

Diffix components are designed to be used as Web Components. This means you import the target component in the script and use it in the HTML.

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={Stories.Usage} />

Form controls should be automatically detectable inside the `form` element. To serialize data from the form, you can use the `FormData`. Client-side validation uses [Constraint Validation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Constraint_validation). You can activate it by using attributes such as `required`, `minlength`, `maxlength`, `pattern`, etc.

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={Stories.Forms} />

Components are published as ES modules, so they can be used in all modern browsers with no build step. That's good for prototyping, but for performance reasons, components in production should be bundled, tree-shaken, and optimized by individual applications using bundlers like Webpack, Rollup, or Vite.

There is a [simple demo](https://github.com/dominikfryc/diffix-test/blob/next/demo/) using Vite to showcase the usage of individual components.

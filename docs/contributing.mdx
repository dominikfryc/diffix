# Contributing

All contributions are welcomed to the project! There are many ways to contribute:

- **Improve documentation**: Fix incomplete or missing docs, bad wording, examples, or explanations.
- **Give feedback**: Propose new components or features via GitHub Issues.
- **Share the project**: Share the link to the docs or GitHub with everyone who might be interested.
- **Give a code review**: Help identify problems with the source code or make it more performant.
- **Contribute to the codebase**: Find an existing issue you are interested in and work on it!

## Contributing workflow

1. Decide on what you want to contribute.
2. If you want to implement a new feature, discuss it with the maintainer before coding.
3. Please make sure to follow commit rules and coding conventions.
4. Run tests and submit a PR targeting the `next` branch once all tests have passed.
5. Get a code review and fix all issues mentioned by the maintainer.
6. Your PR is merged. You successfully contributed to the project!

## Commit rules

Please follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) rules when writing commit messages. This will help us to automate the release flow and generate changelog notes. Commits should follow this mandatory format:

<Source
  code={`
<type>(<optional scope>): <subject>
`}
/>

Example:

<Source
  code={`
feat(button): add loading state
`}
/>

The type should be one of the following:

- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies.
- **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts.
- **docs**: Documentation only changes.
- **feat**: A new feature.
- **fix**: A bug fix.
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance.
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (whitespace, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.).
- **test**: Adds missing tests or corrects existing tests.
- **revert**: Reverts a previous commit.

Scope is optional and should be used when the change affects only a specific component or a part of the project.

The subject contains a short description of the change. Use the imperative, present tense: "change", not "changed", nor "changes", don't capitalize the first letter, and don't write a dot (.) at the end.

Learn more in [Angular Commit Message Guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines).

## Coding conventions

The project uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to enforce coding conventions. Follow the setup rules to ensure the code is easily read and consistent with the existing codebase. Please run `pnpm lint` and `pnpm format:check` before submitting a PR.

There are some rules for developing new components:

- Web components:
  - Should be prefixed with `dfx-` to avoid collisions with other components.
  - Should document all attributes, events, slots, CSS properties, and CSS parts with [TSDoc](https://tsdoc.org/).
  - Custom events should be prefixed with `dfx-` to avoid collisions with other events.
- Custom CSS properties in components:
  - Should be prefixed with `--dfx-component-name`.
  - Should use the design tokens instead of hardcoded values.
  - Should set default values in case the design tokens are not available.
- Components should be documented with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).
  - Add a story for each component attribute to demonstrate how it works and how it should be used.
  - Add a story to showcase slot usage if the component has any.
- Components should be tested with [Web Test Runner](https://modern-web.dev/docs/test-runner/overview/). Please make sure to add tests at least for the following cases:
  - Test if the component (custom element) is defined.
  - Test if the component renders correctly with default values.
  - Test if the component renders correctly with custom attributes.
  - Test if the component fires defined events correctly.
  - Test if the component passes the accessibility audit.

## Get started locally

- Fork the [repository](https://github.com/dominikfryc/diffix), then clone or download your fork.
- Install dependencies with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/).
- Run the Storybook with `pnpm start`.
- Lint the project with `pnpm lint:fix`.
- Format the project with `pnpm format`.
- Build the project with `pnpm build`.
- Run tests with `pnpm test`.
- Optionally generate a new component with `pnpm generate component-name`.

## Release flow

The project uses [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/) to automate the release flow. Every commit triggers a release flow based on the branch:

- **main**: Released in `latest` npm channel. Every push to the `main` branch makes a stable release.
- **next**: Released in `next` npm channel. Every push to the `next` branch makes a preview release.

The semantic release follows semantic versioning rules. When a commit is marked as `BREAKING CHANGE` in the commit message, that push creates a major release in the current channel. Backward incompatible changes should have breaking change commits. We'll avoid making breaking changes as much as possible. When some commits have a `feat` prefix in the message, that push creates a minor release. Finally, when some commits have a `fix` prefix in the message, and there are not any `feat` commits, that push creates a patch release.

With every release, the new version is published to npm. The semantic release also automatically creates a GitHub Release with autogenerated release notes, including all commits since the last release. We are not directly pushing changes to the `main` and `next` branches. The `main` branch will only be updated by a PR from the `next` branch that contains features/fixes that we are ready to release as a stable release. All changes for the current version will be submitted in PRs targeting the `next` branch. PRs are not making any releases.
